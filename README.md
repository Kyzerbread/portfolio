# Welcome

If you're reading this, you're probably here to judge my code. I hope you enjoy it!

Unless you are that one Alex (you know who you are), in which case, get out of here.

## What is this?

It's a portfolio site made with Svelte + SvelteKit.

There is no other real dependencies, other than the ones that come with Svelte.
Feel free to look around, this code was all hand written and maintained by me.

### Why Svelte?

No real reason other than I wanted to try it out.

### How do I run it?

I don't know why you would want to, but if you do, you can run it with `npm run dev`.
